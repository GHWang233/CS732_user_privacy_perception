# CS732_user_privacy_perception
This is the code we used for data analysis in our CMSC 732 course project. The plots are also included. 

Simply run main.py with the xlsx file under same directory will give you the results. The plots have to be generated individually(comment out the rest), because we had to adjust font and bins respectivly.
