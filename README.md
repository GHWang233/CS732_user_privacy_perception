# CS732_user_privacy_perception
This is the code we used for data analysis in our CMSC 732 course project. The plotting is also included. Note that right now we are still working on our final report, so the code is subject to change.

Simply run main.py with the xlsx file under same directory will give you the results. The plots have to be generated individually(comment out the rest), because we had to adjust font and bins respectivly.
